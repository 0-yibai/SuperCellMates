By default, only logged in users can access our infrastructure. You must log in to conduct the tests, unless stated otherwise.
Trivial test cases are included in logged_out section but omitted everywhere else. Trivial test cases include blank input fields, which is pure frontend and does not involve communication with backend.
For websocket, our redis host on Heroku is slightly unstable. Hence first attempt to connect may fail. You may need to refresh one time to successfully connect.
