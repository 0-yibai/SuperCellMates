We have conducted another round of feedback collection. Users are asked to rate the complexity, importance, visibility and navigability of the overall app, with 5 being the most positive and 1 being the most negative. Click on the details tab to see the results of the survey.
Some of the suggestions are communicated outside of the google form and hence are not reflected in details tab, but are reflected in summary tab.
The bugs found under the 'bugs' tab are mostly serious bugs that were immediately patched after deployment before any user found out.
