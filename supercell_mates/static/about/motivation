Have you ever wanted a glorious social media profile, but too shy to share your hobbies online? As mainstream social media users ourselves, we totally get the anxiety about the number of likes and comments. Therefore, we aim to develop a platform to facilitate free and unpressured interest-sharing.
Instead of “like” and “share” functionalities that produce little more than superficial interaction, our vision is to allow users to curate their own cellars of niche hobbies, and connect with like-minded individuals on the platform. We hope to create high-quality communities where sharing and socialising are exclusive to those truly passionate about a common hobby.
Beyond that, our app would also foster interactions among friends and newly-formed social circles. As avid board gamers, we have always wanted a platform to find other players, while existing platforms are usually buggy with poorly implemented moderator bots. Hence, we aim to design chat rooms with various social deduction game bot moderators.
