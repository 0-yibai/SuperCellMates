The flow of interaction assumes no internal server error. Internal server error may occur when there are too many connections at the same time to the server, or when there is an error in the code (which there should not be).
The diagrams are somewhat simplified, as one arrow of request from frontend to backend may involve multiple API calls to various endpoints, and one arrow of request from backend to database may involve various tables.
The flow presented may include fetching of HTML templates. This only occurs on web frontend. On mobile frontend, templates are already preloaded in the app, hence there is no communication between frontend and backend for template rendering.
Middlewares are ignored for the sake of simplicity. Interaction flow may differ on marginal circumstances, such as when the user modifies the cookies, causing the user to be logged out or request to be forbidden by CSRF middleware.
In some diagrams, backend never feedback error to frontend. This is because we have made sure that frontend is implemented with sufficient details such that backend never feedback error. Backend still checks for error, and will only feedback error if user sends request directly not through frontend UI (e.g. javascript console, http request tools)
For chat, the sequence only occurs when there are at least 2 users connect in real time. In the case that only one user is present, the sequence occurs as if Frontend2 and User2 are missing.
